# 💅 Amigos Do Mine - Frontend

**The Control Deck.** 🖥️✨

This is where the magic happens visually. Built with the latest and greatest **React 19**, this dashboard gives admins and players full control over their experience. It is sleek, fast, and responsive.

## 🎨 The Design System

We believe in looking good while working hard.
*   **Vibe:** Inspired by the Atlantic Forest 🌿
*   **Typography:** **Nunito** (Easy on the eyes)
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS v4** (Utility-first, no bloat)

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

*   **Core:** React 19
*   **Bundler:** Vite (Lightning fast builds ⚡)
*   **State:** Zustand (Keep it simple, keep it safe)
*   **Http:** Axios (Talking to the Backend)

## 📂 Folder Structure

Organized by **Features**, because scrolling through a 100-file `components` folder is no fun.

```text
src/
├── components/   # 🧱 Atomic UI bricks (Buttons, Inputs)
├── domains/      # 📡 API integration & Stores
├── features/     # 🚀 Full functional modules
│   ├── admin/    # The Command Center
│   └── shop/     # The Storefront
└── i18n/         # 🌍 Global ready (pt-BR default)
```

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
# Fire up the dev server
npm run dev
```
*Visit `http://localhost:5173` and behold!*

> **⚠️ Heads Up:** You need the **Backend** running for features like Login and Shop to actually work!

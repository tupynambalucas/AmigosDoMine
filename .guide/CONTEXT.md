# 🌲 Welcome to the Amigos Do Mine Context

Hey there! 👋 If you're looking for the "Big Picture" of what we're building here, you've found it.

**Amigos Do Mine** is our take on a high-tech Minecraft ecosystem. We aren't just running a server; we're running a full-stack studio. We use a **Monorepo** setup to keep our API, Dashboard, and Game Server all talking the same language.

## 🗺️ Where to go next?

Since you're already here, you're probably looking for one of these:

*   **Want to know WHAT we are building?** Check out **[PRODUCT.md](./PRODUCT.md)**. It's all about the features, the "Atlantic Forest" vibe, and our vision for players and admins. 🎮
*   **Want to know HOW it works?** Head over to **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**. That's where we explain the Fastify backend, the React 19 frontend, and how we sync textures with the game server. 🏗️
*   **Ready to start coding?** **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** is your best friend. It has the setup commands and the "Golden Rules" of the repo. 🛠️
*   **Are you an AI or a strict dev?** **[STYLEGUIDE.md](./STYLEGUIDE.md)** is the law. It's got all the technical commandments you need to follow. 🤖

## 🚀 The TL;DR

*   **Brain**: Fastify v5 (Backend)
*   **Face**: React 19 (Frontend)
*   **Soul**: Purpur 1.21+ (Minecraft)
*   **Glue**: Zod & TypeScript (Shared)

We're all about **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** and making sure the "Develop-Host-Consume" lifecycle for assets is as smooth as butter. 🧈

Enjoy the project! 💜

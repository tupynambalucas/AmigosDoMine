# 📦 Product Overview

**Amigos Do Mine** isn't just a server; it's a whole vibe. 🌟

We are building an ecosystem that smashes together the blocky creativity of Minecraft with the slick performance of the modern web. The goal? To make a server that feels less like a hacked-together plugin soup and more like a polished, standalone game studio experience.

## 1. The Big Vision 🚀

We want to bridge the gap. Usually, Minecraft servers and their websites feel like two strangers living in different houses. We are moving them in together.

*   **For Players:** It's seamless. You join, the custom textures load automatically, your web profile syncs instantly, and the economy just works.
*   **For Admins:** It's a superpower. You have a React 19 dashboard that gives you God-mode control over the server, logs, and economy from anywhere.

## 2. Core Features ✨

### 2.1. Player Experience
*   **Immersive Toys**: We don't just use vanilla items. We have a pipeline for custom 3D models and textures that get delivered straight to the player.
*   **Web Portal**: Check your stats, buy items in the shop, or manage your profile without even opening the game launcher.
*   **One ID to Rule Them All**: Your web login and your Minecraft UUID are best friends.

### 2.2. Admin Powers
*   **Command Center**: A beautiful dashboard (`frontend`) built with TailwindCSS v4. No more squinting at console logs in a terminal window.
*   **The "Studio" Pipeline**: We have a dedicated workspace for creating assets. You build it, we deploy it, and every player gets the update. No more "download this zip file manually" nonsense.

## 3. Why It's Cool (UX) 😎

1.  **Magic Onboarding**: Connect and play. The resource packs handle themselves.
2.  **It Looks Good**: We use an "Atlantic Forest" theme across both the game and the web. Visual consistency is key!
3.  **Speed**: We prioritize high TPS (Ticks Per Second) and low latency APIs. Nobody likes lag.
